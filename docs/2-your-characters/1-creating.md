### Creating Your Citizen

First, you want to sign up and make sure you have a CAD account. If you don't have one, head over to the [CAD section](/docs/the-cad/the-cad) and follow the instructions there.

<br/>

<details open>
  <summary>CAD - **Navigate to the Citizen Creaton Portal**</summary>

Select the citizen dropdown on the header and select the "Citizens" page, then press "Create Citizen" then fill out the required information, and the optional sections if you wish, and then save your citizen.

The following screenshots will show you what the process looks like.

### Create Button Not Working?

:::danger This Is Known!
The CAD System isn't great with giving you immediate feedback with that button currently. We know.

If it seems to not do anything - click "Previous" a until you spot a red message next to a box - it means something you input was not valid and you need to fix it.
