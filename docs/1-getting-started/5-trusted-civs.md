# Civilian Levels

<br/>

:::tip Trusted Civilians & Levels
As a public server, we have to be careful about what we allow the players to do. The reason for this is to eliminate cheating, fail roleplay and other forms of misconduct. To help us with this, we have a new system in place which allows us to reward players for being active (and their roleplaying skills) in the server, while also preventing new players from being able to abuse some of our features. Once you join the discord you will get a civillian role, which allows you to join the game and play, but once you get trusted by the owners (paneedah and skyy) you will get a trusted civillian role, which having that role allows you to have more cooler, and faster cars, also allowing you to have a bigger variety of guns.

In short, we have a "civilian level" system, which allows us to give certain privileges to certain players, based on their level of civilian status. This is to prevent players from being able to abuse the server, and to help us keep the game fun for everyone.
