# 32 Sirens Plugin

<br/>

**What is SirenSetting Limit Adjuster ("32 Sirens")?**<br/>
In simple terms, the 32 Sirens Plugin enhances the lighting of our emergency vehicles, making them more vibrant and noticeable.

:::info Advanced Definition
The SirenSetting Limit Adjuster 2.0.2 is an ASI that modifies the GTAV siren buffer limit. Instead of the default 21 lights per vehicle, it allows up to 32 lights.

Additionally, it increases the number of light object ID's allowed by FiveM natively from 255 to a whopping 65535. This expansion enables more custom lights for all vehicles, providing a richer visual experience.

*Notice how the vehicle in the middle doesn't have a blue light on the light bar? Or, how about the rear yellow advisory light on that same vehicle that doesn't exist on the original?*
