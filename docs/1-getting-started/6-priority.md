# Priority Status

<br/>

:::tip What is the Priority Status?
Priority Status is a system we use to help balance the action on the server. It ensures that our LEOs aren’t overwhelmed by too many big scenes happening all at once.

When you have Priority Status, it’s your time to shine, allowing you to create and run large, exciting scenes like pursuits, shootings, bank robberies, and more!

## When should I have Priority Status?

The priority status should be requested any time that you plan to have a **large scene** happening which may involve multiple players and take up a **decent amount of LEO/FIRE/EMS resources**.

A good example of this would be a pursuit, where you are running from a group of LEOs, or even a robbery, where you are trying to get the money from the bank. In these cases, you will need Priority Status to ensure that you can run the scene smoothly.

<br/>

:::danger A Few Important Reminders

- **If Priority Status is already taken, on cooldown, or disabled, please hold off on starting any large scenes.**
- Priority Status is crucial for scenes that require most or all LEO resources, so make sure to request it before you begin.
- Priority should always be used for; Pursuits, Shooting, Bank Robberies, Hostage Situations, Large MVA, Large Fires, etc
