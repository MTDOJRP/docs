# Microphone Setup

<br/>

:::tip Microphone Setup
Welcome to the guide to setting up your in-game voice chat. It is highly recommended you ensure this is setup prior to beginning your roleplay to ensure you can interact with other players.

Unless you have changed the settings in the past, Voice Chat will (by default) be turned off. Follow the steps below to setup the voice chat for the first time.

## First-Time Setup

1. **Open Your Settings:** Go into the pause menu, and navigate to the settings tab. Locate the "Voice Chat" section.
2. **Enable and Set Defaults:** Check to ensure that the voice chat is enabled for **both** listening & talking. Set your input device to the microphone you normally use, and set the output device to the speaker you normally use.
3. **Adjust Volumes:** It is recommended that you max out the `Voice Chat Volume`, reduce the `SFX Volume during Voice Chat` setting to close to half, and adjust the `Music Volume during Voice Chat` to your preferred level. Under the Talking section it is recommended you change your `Voice Chat Mode` to Push To Talk, adjust the `Microphone Volume` to max. If you are going to set `Voice Chat Mode` to Voice Activated then you will need to adjust the `Microphone Sensitivity` to your preferred level.
4. **Set Your Keybinds:** Navigate to the Key Bindings settings, then GTA Online, then locate the `Push to Talk` action. You may adjust this binding to any binding that works best for you.

## How to Use Voice Chat

Voice chat is used when you're speaking in character, to roleplay scenarios and communicate with other players.<br/>

However, we do not use the voice chat to define what our characters are currently doing. You can use commands such as `/me` or `/ooc` to communicate actions with other players.

<br/>

:::info Voice Chat Keybind
Your default keybind will be `N`. But, you can change that to any other key you want by going to the `Settings > Key Bindings > GTA Online > Push To Talk` section.

By pressing this key you will activate the voice chat and you will be able to talk to other players. Make sure that you hold down the key to talk, and release it to stop talking.

## Voice Range

In the bottom right corner of the screen you will see `Normal [Range]`, this shows what range your voice chat is set to.
- `Whisper` is short range, quiet, meant for more discreet conversations.
- `Normal` is a talking voice, where others can hear you at a reasonable distance.
- `Shouting` is loud, meant for others to hear over long distances and over noisy environments.
