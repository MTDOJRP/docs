:::info Be Patient
Connecting for the first time may take anywhere between 1 and 10 minutes depending on the speed of your machine and internet connection.
To try and make this process as smooth as possible, we recommend using a wired connection!
- We aim to compress our assets as much as possible without sacrificing quality to make this process faster.

<br/>

#### Remember!
Once you download these assets and connect, your client will cache them. This means that if you join the server again, it will not take as long to connect!
