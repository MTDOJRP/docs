# Area of Play

<br/>

:::tip What is the Area of Play?
The Area of Play (aka. the "AOP") is the area of the map that you can freely roam and roleplay in.

## Why does it exist?

When the server has a lower population, we implement what we call the "AOP" to keep the players from getting too spread out. The reason for this is that if you're in a smaller area, you will be more likely to see and interact with other players, which can lead to a more enjoyable experience.

<br/>

## What does it look like?

The AOP is a circle on both your main map and mini-map that is centered and locked to a certain location (for example, Sandy Shores).<br/>
In the image below, you can see the **AOP** is in the **Sandy Shores** area (the red circle).

:::warning Can I Leave The AOP?
Yes, you may leave the Area of Play for any of the following reasons:

- **You are not a far distance from the AOP.**<br/>
  *We allow you to leave the AOP as long as you don't get too far away from it.*

- **Customizing your experience.**<br/>
  *You can leave the AOP if you are not actively roleplaying - but would rather customize your experience (creating characters, vehicles, etc.)*

- **You're in a pursuit and running from LEO.**<br/>
  *You may only do this if you **actively have [priority](/docs/getting-started/priority)** on the server.*
