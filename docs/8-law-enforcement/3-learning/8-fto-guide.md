## Sections 1-3 / Accepting & Initial Setup

Before we get into the training session, we need to make sure that the recruit is ready to go and has all the necessary information to participate. This section will cover all the initial setup and preparation for the training session, as well as making sure the recruit has the necessary permissions before they log online.

<br/>

### 1. Application & Review

A recruit will complete the [application process](/docs/law-enforcement/apply). Upon submission of the application a ticket will be opened in the Discord server with the application, which all supervisors will review the within the private thread attached.

Once reviewed and accepted, we will move forward with the FTO process.

<br/>

### 2. Acceptance Message & Discord Roles

Once accepted, an FTO certified supervisor will grant the department specific role along with the department recruit role to the member. This will grant the recruit all the permissions in the CAD and in-game.

Then, the supervisor will post a message accepting the recruit in the ticket, as well as posting an update within [#roster-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1270093499110395944)!

<br/>

:::warning Permission Updates
The recruit will likely need to fully logout from the [CAD](https://cad.kcdojrp.com) and re-login via Discord to gain access to the new permissions.

In addition, if the recruit is online on the server at the time of being given roles, they will have to re-sync their in-game menu using the [KC Menu](/docs/kc-menu/kcmenu) to gain access to the new permissions.
:::

:::danger Permission Abuse Prevention
Please note that the recruit will receive in-game permissions **the moment** they are given the role(s) in Discord. If the recruit's training session is delayed, make sure to remove their permissions from discord until they are ready to log in to prevent any accidents with mis-using permissions that they have not been trained on using yet.
:::

<br/>

### 3. Officer & CAD Setup

The recruit will now be instructed to follow the [Officer Setup](/docs/law-enforcement/learning/setting-up) guide to set up their officer on the CAD System with the information provided by the supervisor.

<br/>

**Information that will be provided to the recruit:**
- Their new call-sign
- The department they will be joining
- Their rank

<br/>

<details>
  <summary>FTO - Approving the recruit in the CAD System</summary>

  A supervisor will need to accept the officer's request to be added to the CAD System. You can do this by finding the user under `Admin > Manage Units > Pending Units` and clicking the `Approve` button.

  **Beware!** Make sure that the user has put in the correct call-sign! If they haven't, notify the user of the mistake and deny the officer request. They should re-submit their request on the CAD following the instructions in the [Officer Setup](/docs/law-enforcement/learning/setting-up) guide.

  Make sure to accept this request right before the training session starts, as we don't want the recruit to have access to the officer side of the CAD System before their training session.

## Sections 4-7 / Information & Theory

Once we've got everything else set up, we can move on to training the recruit in-game and in-character. This section will cover the basics of the in-game and in-character features & the majority of what you need to know about it.

This is an information-heavy section, so try to deliver the information to the recruit in a way they can understand! **Avoid overwhelming them and make sure to keep the session fun!**

<br/>

### 4. CAD Usage & Penal Codes
