**This guide is designed for Field Training Officers (FTOs) and Evaluators responsible for training cadets**.
This document outlines the procedures and expectations to ensure a consistent and thorough training process across all law enforcement officers.

Recruits are to be respectful and obey all KCDOJRP rules during the training process. The instructor must abide by all the procedures laid out on this page.

## Sections 1-3 / Accepting & Initial Setup

Before we get into the training session, we need to make sure that the recruit is ready to go and has all the necessary information to participate. This section will cover all the initial setup and preparation for the training session, as well as making sure the recruit has the necessary permissions before they log online.

<br/>

### 1. Application & Review

A recruit will complete the [application process](/docs/law-enforcement/apply). Upon submission of the application a ticket will be opened in the Discord server with the application, which all supervisors will review the within the private thread attached.

Once reviewed and accepted, we will move forward with the FTO process.

<br/>

### 2. Acceptance Message & Discord Roles

Once accepted, an FTO certified supervisor will grant the department specific role along with the department recruit role to the member. This will grant the recruit all the permissions in the CAD and in-game.

Then, the supervisor will post a message accepting the recruit in the ticket, as well as posting an update within [#roster-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1270093499110395944)!

<br/>

:::warning Permission Updates
The recruit will likely need to fully logout from the [CAD](https://cad.kcdojrp.com) and re-login via Discord to gain access to the new permissions.

In addition, if the recruit is online on the server at the time of being given roles, they will have to re-sync their in-game menu using the [KC Menu](/docs/kc-menu/kcmenu) to gain access to the new permissions.
:::

:::danger Permission Abuse Prevention
Please note that the recruit will receive in-game permissions **the moment** they are given the role(s) in Discord. If the recruit's training session is delayed, make sure to remove their permissions from discord until they are ready to log in to prevent any accidents with mis-using permissions that they have not been trained on using yet.
:::

<br/>

### 3. Officer & CAD Setup

The recruit will now be instructed to follow the [Officer Setup](/docs/law-enforcement/learning/setting-up) guide to set up their officer on the CAD System with the information provided by the supervisor.

<br/>

**Information that will be provided to the recruit:**
- Their new call-sign
- The department they will be joining
- Their rank

<br/>

<details>
  <summary>FTO - Approving the recruit in the CAD System</summary>

  A supervisor will need to accept the officer's request to be added to the CAD System. You can do this by finding the user under `Admin > Manage Units > Pending Units` and clicking the `Approve` button.

  **Beware!** Make sure that the user has put in the correct call-sign! If they haven't, notify the user of the mistake and deny the officer request. They should re-submit their request on the CAD following the instructions in the [Officer Setup](/docs/law-enforcement/learning/setting-up) guide.

  Make sure to accept this request right before the training session starts, as we don't want the recruit to have access to the officer side of the CAD System before their training session.
</details>

<br/>

<br/>

## Sections 4-7 / Information & Theory

Once we've got everything else set up, we can move on to training the recruit in-game and in-character. This section will cover the basics of the in-game and in-character features & the majority of what you need to know about it.

This is an information-heavy section, so try to deliver the information to the recruit in a way they can understand! **Avoid overwhelming them and make sure to keep the session fun!**

<br/>

### 4. CAD Usage & Penal Codes 

From here, have the recruit go **10-6** for the first time on the Officer Dashboard! Once the recruit is 10-6; go over all the various 10 status codes with them.

<details open>
  <summary>**Status 10-Codes**</summary>

<br/>

### 8. Map Knowledge & Driving Test

This section tests the recruit's knowledge of the map and their ability to drive. Here's the things you want to do for the map testing:
- Ask some basic question about the state, such as "Where is Paleto Bay?", "Where is Grove Street?", etc.
- In this section introduce the recruit to the postal code system and the [`/postal (code)` command](/docs/postal-codes/postal-cmd).

## Questions & Final Evaluation

At the end of the training, evaluate the recruit based on their performance across all phases.

:::info Evaluation Criteria
- A recruit is allowed *3 minor mistakes per phase* and only *3 major mistakes* throughout the entire process, or *1 critical mistake*.
- Failing this process requires the recruit to review the documentation and re-schedule the training.
- **Multiple failures necessitate resubmission of the initial application.**
:::

<br/>

### Possible Outcomes

This will give you an idea for what the outcomes for your recruit can be (based on their performance during the session).

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs defaultValue="2">
  <TabItem value="1" label="Outcome 1 - Exceptional Pass" default>

:::info Exceptional Performance!
Your recruit has passed the entire training process with **minimal errors**, demonstrating an **exceptional grasp of all required skills and knowledge**.
This is a noteworthy achievement – so congratulate them!

The recruit is awarded a **Strong Pass** and is **authorized for independent patrol without restrictions**.<br/>
:::

*Ensure you promote your recruit to Standard LEO both in the CAD system and by updating their Discord Roles, as well as posting a roster update in [#roster-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1270093499110395944).*

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="2" label="Outcome 2 - Standard Pass">

:::tip Ready for Supervised Patrol
The recruit has **met the requirements** for passing the training, **demonstrating competence in core areas** with some areas for improvement.

Your recruit will now begin **patrolling under the supervision of a Higher Ranking LEO** until deemed ready for independent patrol by a supervisor.
:::

*Your recruit should remain as a probationary until they are deemed ready for independent patrol by a supervisor. Make sure to post a roster update in [#roster-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1270093499110395944) to notify that training is complete.*

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3" label="Outcome 3 - Fail">

:::danger Further Development Required
Unfortunately, the recruit has **not yet met the requirements** for passing the training at this time.

The recruit will be notified and have their **Discord & CAD permissions revoked at this time**.

Recruits are required to follow a **2-week period** for **review of training materials before re-attempting training**. If this is the recruit's first time getting denied (and there's no critical mistakes), the recruit may **re-schedule** (this must still follow a 2-week period).
:::

*Even if the recruit is re-scheduling, ensure that you remove their permissions from the Discord server and revoke their access to the CAD system at this time.*

## Final Notes

- Ensure recruits are respectful and follow all KCRP rules during training.
- FTOs must adhere to these procedures to maintain training consistency.
- After successful training, recruits are ready for active duty under probation.
