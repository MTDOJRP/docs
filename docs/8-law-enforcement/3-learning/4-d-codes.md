:::tip What are "David" Codes?
"David Codes", or D-Codes, are used to quickly communicate the outcome or disposition of an incident or interaction. After handling a situation, officers use D-Codes to efficiently update dispatch and other units on what action was taken and the result.

Think of them as a quick summary of what happened.
