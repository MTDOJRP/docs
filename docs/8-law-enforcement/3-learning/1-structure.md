## How do callsigns work?

A callsign is a unique identifier for each officer/deputy. It is used to communicate with other officers and deputies, and is also used to track and manage the department's resources. **The first two letters represent the department, and the last two digits represent the unit number.**

<br/>

  <summary>Callsigns - **Definitions**</summary> -->

  #### Department Codes:
  - `1` = **San Andreas Highway Patrol (SAHP)**
  - `2` = **Blaine County Sheriff's Office (BCSO)**
  - `3` = **Los Santos Police Department (LSPD)**
  - `4` = **Los Santos Sheriff's Office (LSSO)**
  - `5` = **Sandy Shores Police Department (SSPD)**<br/><br/>
  *These codes are found as the **first number** within the callsign.*<br/>
  *For example, the callsign `2C-03` has a department code of `2` - which is the **BCSO**.*

  <br/>

  #### Rank/Unit Type:
  - `A` = **Air Unit**
  - `C` = **Captain/Command**
  - `S` = **Sergeant**
  - `L` = **Lieutenant**
  - `K` = **K9**
  - `T` = **Two/Dual Units**
  - `N` = **Probationary Deputy**
  - `U` = **Standard**
  - `V` = **Corporal**
  - `M` = **Marine**<br/><br/>
  *These codes are found as the **second character** within the callsign.*<br/>
  *For example, the callsign `2C-03` has a rank/unit type of `C` - which is the **Captain/Command**.*

  <summary>Callsigns - **Examples**</summary>

  Callsigns will follow the following format: *`{department}{rank/unit type}`-`{2 digit unit number}`*<br/>
  **For Example:** `2C-03`

  <br/>

  #### Let's break this down:
  - The first two characters `2C` represent the department and rank/unit type. In this case, it's the `BCSO (Blaine County Sheriff's Office)` with a `Chief Deputy` rank.

  - The last two characters `03` represent the unit number. There isn't a hidden meaning to this, it's just a unique number for each unit within the department.
