# Phonetic Alphabet

:::tip Understanding the Civilian Phonetic Alphabet

In radio communications, especially in situations where clarity is crucial (like law enforcement or EMS), similar-sounding letters can easily be confused. Think about how "B" and "D", or "M" and "N" can sound alike over a radio.

To avoid misunderstandings and ensure accurate communication, we use the **Phonetic Alphabet**. Instead of just saying the letter, we use a specific word to represent each letter. This word is easily understood and minimizes confusion, no matter the quality of the audio connection.

#### "Civilian Alphabet" as Primary

This documentation uses the **Civilian Phonetic Alphabet**. You'll notice the words are common names and everyday terms. This alphabet is widely used in civilian contexts, including law enforcement within many communities.

While the **NATO Phonetic Alphabet** (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.) is also well-known and perfectly acceptable to use, **we recommend becoming proficient with the Civilian Alphabet as it is our primary phonetic alphabet**. Familiarizing yourself with this Civilian Alphabet will be essential for clear and effective communication.
