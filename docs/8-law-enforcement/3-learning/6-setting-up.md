## ✍️ Written Guide

Don't want to watch the video, or simply prefer to have a written guide? Here's a quick summary of the steps you need to take to set up your officer on the CAD System!

<br/>

### Create a Citizen

The first thing you need to do is either create a new citizen or find an existing one that you can use.<br/>
If you're creating a new citizen, you can use the [Create Citizen](/docs/your-characters/creating) guide to do so!

<br/>

:::warning Citizen Requirements
When creating a new citizen (or using an existing one), your citizen **must** meet the following requirements:
  - be over the **age of 18**,
  - not have a **criminal history** and,
  - have a **valid driver's license**.
:::

<details open>
  <summary>Citizen - **Create a New Citizen**</summary>

  You can view the [Create Citizen](/docs/your-characters/creating) guide to learn how to create a new citizen! Make sure to follow all the steps listed, and once you get to the end - don't create the citizen yet! Come back to this guide and continue from here.

  You should now see a button that says `Create with Officer` next to the button to `Create` at the end of your citizen creation process. You want to select that instead!

  <br/>

  <div class="text--center">
    <i>Make sure to enter the call-sign of your officer in the `Callsign` field!<br/></i>
    <i>**For Example:** If your call-sign is `1C-01`, you'd input `1C` in field 1, and `01` in field 2.</i> 
  </div>
</details>

<br/>

<br/>

### Create an Officer

If while creating your citizen, you did not select `Create with Officer`, or, if you're using an existing citizen. You'll need to follow this guide!
*If you already used the `Create with Officer` button, you can skip this step!*

<br/>

<details open>
  <summary>Citizen - **Make your Citizen an Officer**</summary>

  The first thing you want to do is open up and log into the [CAD System](https://cad.kcdojrp.com/).<br/>
  ***Don't know how to log in?** Check out the [Guide on using the CAD](/docs/the-cad/the-cad)!**

  <br/>

  Once you're logged in, you'll want to hit `Officers > My Officers`, and then `Create Officer`. I've included a screenshot below to show you what you should see.

  <br/>

  ![Showcase of the Create Officer button](/imgs/find-create-officer.png)

  <div class="text--center">
    <i>If you can't see the `Officer` tab, try to log out of the CAD System and log back in! If that doesn't work, contact your supervisor!</i>
  </div>

  <br/><br/>

  Proceed to fill out the form on your screen, and make sure to select the correct citizen! Here's a screenshot of what you should see when you've filled out the form.

  ![Showcase of the Create Officer form](/imgs/create-officer-example.png)

  <div class="text--center">
    <i>Make sure to enter the call-sign of your officer in the `Callsign` field!<br/></i>
    <i>**For Example:** If your call-sign is `1C-01`, you'd input `1C` in field 1, and `01` in field 2.</i> 
  </div>

  <br/>

  Once you've filled out the form, hit `Create` and a request will be sent to your supervisor to approve your request.
</details>

<br/>

### You're Done!

Your supervisor will now be able to see your new officer on the CAD System, and you should be notified as soon as your request has been approved on our side!
