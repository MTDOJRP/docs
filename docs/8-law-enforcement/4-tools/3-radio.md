## How do I use it?

First, you want to run the `/radio` command in-game. This will open up the in-game radio menu - like so.

  - Set the **Radio Frequency** to `155` MHz.
  - Turn up the **Radio Volume** to `100`.
  - **Turn on** the **Radio**.

## How do I talk over the radio?

Once you've configured the radio and connected to the correct frequency, you can start talking to other officers.

<details open>
  <summary>Radio - **Usage**</summary>

  To talk over the radio, you will have a `Push To Talk` button configured in your **FiveM Settings**. You must press and hold this key to talk.

  - To change the key, go to `Settings > Key Bindings > FiveM > "(pma-voice) Talk over Radio"`.<br/>
    *By default, this is set to `LEFT ALT`*
