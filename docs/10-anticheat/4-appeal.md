# Appeal a Punishment

<br/>

### How can I appeal a punishment?

There is currently only one way to appeal a punishment - through Discord.

<br/>

1. **Appealing in Discord** - You can appeal a punishment in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kcdojrp) by opening a support ticket in the [#support-and-information](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1134209356708196392) channel.
