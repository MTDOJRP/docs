### How can I report someone?

Here's the main ways you can report someone for breaking the rules on Kelly County!

<br/>

1. **Reporting in Discord** - You can report a player in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kcdojrp) by opening a support ticket in the [#support-and-information](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1134209356708196392) channel.

2. **Reporting in-game** - You can report a player in-game by using the **/report** command or in the custom pause menu.
