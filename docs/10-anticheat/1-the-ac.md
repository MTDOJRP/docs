### Kelly County Roleplay's Anti-Cheat

To ensure a fair and enjoyable gameplay experience for all members of our community, Kelly County Roleplay utilizes a custom-built anti-cheat system. This system, known as **KCAC (Kelly County Anti-Cheat)**, has been developed in-house by me! ([Paneedah](https://github.com/Paneedah))

  <br/>
  
  #### Our Anti-Cheat is designed to seamlessly integrate with all of our custom-built scripts, features and tools!
  
  *This allows us to provide a comprehensive and effective anti-cheat that is always being updated and improved. We can easily add new checks and improve them as needed without having to worry about compatibility issues.*

### Under Constant Development

We aim to keep our Anti-Cheat updated and improved as we continue to develop new features and tools over time. However, we understand that it is not perfect and may occasionally encounter issues or bugs. **With that said, we are committed to providing a reliable and effective anti-cheat that will help keep our community safe and enjoyable.**

<br/>

:::danger It Is Not Perfect
No matter how hard we try, we cannot guarantee that our Anti-Cheat will be perfect. "Perfect code" is not actually possible to achieve - there is always room for improvement, especially in the realm of anti-cheat development.

<br/>

#### So, here's a few things to keep in mind:
- Keep an eye on our [Blog](/blog/) for updates and announcements related to our Anti-Cheat.
- If you encounter any issues, bugs, or unexpected behavior, please report it to us as soon as possible!
- If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvements, please don't hesitate to share them with us!

### How Do I Report Issues?

Without our community's support, development of our Anti-Cheat will get very difficult. Reporting issues is a crucial part of keeping our Anti-Cheat up-to-date and improving it over time.
