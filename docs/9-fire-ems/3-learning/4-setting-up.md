## ✍️ Written Guide

Don't want to watch the video, or simply prefer to have a written guide? Here's a quick summary of the steps you need to take to set up your deputy on the CAD System!

<br/>

### Create a Citizen

The first thing you need to do is either create a new citizen or find an existing one that you can use.<br/>
If you're creating a new citizen, you can use the [Create Citizen](/docs/your-characters/creating) guide to do so!

<br/>

:::warning Citizen Requirements
When creating a new citizen (or using an existing one), your citizen **must** meet the following requirements:
  - be over the **age of 18**,
  - not have a **criminal history** and,
  - have a **valid driver's license**.

  You can view the [Create Citizen](/docs/your-characters/creating) guide to learn how to create a new citizen! Make sure to follow all the steps listed, and once you get to the end, come back to this guide and continue from here!

<br/>

<br/>

### Create a Deputy

Follow the steps below to submit a request for your deputy to be added into the CAD System!

<details open>
  <summary>Citizen - **Make your Citizen a Deputy**</summary>

  The first thing you want to do is open up and log into the [CAD System](https://cad.kcdojrp.com/).<br/>
  ***Don't know how to log in?** Check out the [Guide on using the CAD](/docs/the-cad/the-cad)!**

  <br/>

  Once you're logged in, you'll want to hit `EMS/FD > My Deputies`, and then `Create Deputy`. I've included a screenshot below to show you what you should see.

  <br/>

  <div class="text--center">
    <i>If you can't see the `EMS/FD` tab, try to log out of the CAD System and log back in! If that doesn't work, contact your supervisor!</i>
  </div>

  <br/><br/>

  Proceed to fill out the form on your screen, and make sure to select the correct citizen! Here's a screenshot of what you should see when you've filled out the form.

  <img src="/imgs/create-deputy-example.png"></img>

  <div class="text--center">
    <i>Make sure to enter the call-sign of your deputy in the `Callsign` field!<br/></i>
    <i>**For Example:** If your call-sign is `90-10`, you'd input `90` in field 1, and `10` in field 2.</i> 
  </div>

  <br/>

  Once you've filled out the form, hit `Create` and a request will be sent to your supervisor to approve your request.
</details>

### You're Done!

Your supervisor will now be able to see your new deputy on the CAD System, and you should be notified as soon as your request has been approved on our side!
