## Sections 1-3 / Accepting and Initial Setup

Before training starts, we need to ensure the Cadet(s) are ready and have all the necessary tools and information to participate fully. This section will cover initial setup of the cad and prepation for the training session, as well as making sure the Cadet(s) has the necessary permissions before they log online and start training. 


## Application & Review

A recruit will submit an application [here](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/leo/apply#application-process), Upon submission of the application a ticket will be opened in the Discord server with the application. We will review the applicant application in the private thread attached.

Once reviewed and accepted, We will move forward with the FTO process.

## Discord Roles

Upon acceptance before training we will grant the department specific role along with the department recruit role to the member.
This will grant the recruit all the permissions in the CAD and in-game.

Then post in the [#roster-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1270093499110395944) the updated positions!

The recruit will likely need to fully logout of the [CAD](https://cad.kcdojrp.com) and re-login via Discord to gain access to the new permissions.

If the recruit doesn't already have a citizen in the CAD they will need to [create one.](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/cad/citizens)

Next, Head over to the "Deputy" tab and then "[My Deputies](https://cad.kcdojrp.com/officer/my-officers)". Select "Create Deputy" select the citizen, and give the call sign based off the [roster](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/fire-ems/roster).

From here, Have the recruit go Busy for the first time on the Deputy Dashboard!

<br/>
### 3. Deputy & CAD Setup

The recruit will now be instructed to follow the [Deputy Setup](/docs/fire-ems/learning/setting-up) guide to set up their Deputy on the CAD System with the information provided by the supervisor.

<br/>

<br/>

**Information that will be provided to the recruit:**
- Their new call-sign
- The department they will be joining
- Their rank

<br/>

<details>
  <summary>FTO - Approving the recruit in the CAD System</summary>

  A supervisor will need to accept the officer's request to be added to the CAD System. You can do this by finding the user under `Admin > Manage Units > Pending Units` and clicking the `Approve` button.

  **Beware!** Make sure that the user has put in the correct call-sign! If they haven't, notify the user of the mistake and deny the officer request. They should re-submit their request on the CAD following the instructions in the [Deputy Setup](/docs/fire-ems/learning/setting-up) guide.

  Make sure to accept this request right before the training session starts, as we don't want the recruit to have access to the deputy side of the CAD System before their training session.

## Sections 4-7 / Information & Theory

Once we've got everything else set up, we can move on to training the recruit in-game and in-character. This section will cover the basics of the in-game and in-character features & the majority of what you need to know about it.

This is an information-heavy section, so try to deliver the information to the recruit in a way they can understand! **Avoid overwhelming them and make sure to keep the session fun!**

### 7. Driving Test

  This part is important to make sure the Cadet(s) know how to drive the various apparatus's such as the Engine, the Ladder Truck, the Ambulance and the Brush Truck. During this test, you will ensure you teach them how to operate the water cannons on the engine, and the brush truck. Ensure they know how to turn on the lights and sirens, and teach them about the speed limiter. To guage them on their driving, start the test from the station in Paleto and drive the engine, ladder or ambulance to the station in Sandy Shores. Make sure they follow the speedlimit, and while driving, ask some questions about them, get to know them. Make sure to tell them how to clear an intersection using the lights, sirens and horn. 


  ### 8. Fire Fighting

  Using the Tower at the station in Sandy Shores, teach the Cadet(s) about fires, going into detail about how to call out the details, such as the side of the fire, the direction of smoke, the amount of floors the fire is on, and the color of the smoke. Indicate the various different smoke colors and what they indicate, black being a regular fire, and green being a electrical fire or a chemical fire. Ensure they know how to fight the various fires, using water on the regular fire, and foam on the electrical and chemical fire. Teach them how to do /hose, or use the FD Menu to get it. Teach them to do a primary search, going through the fire with a hose, clearing the way searching for any surivors, making sure they call out and asking if anyone is there. Simulate a scenario where a person is in the fire, and teach them how to extricate the person and bring them to safety. If you feel they need to do it again, have them do it again until they feel comfortable with it. Afterwards, teach them to do a secondary search, making sure they didnt miss any victims inside. After doing this, and making sure they are comfortable, have them put out the fire. After the fire is completely out, teach them to check for "hotspots" by going around the building. **Use /e camera**. 


  ### 9. Medical Procedures

    Medical is a big part of being a member of the San Andreas Fire Department. It is important that all Cadet(s) learn how to do basic medical.  Teach the Cadets the following. 

    When arriving on a scene it is important to do the following :

   - Assess the paitent. Make sure they are concious and alert. If they are, ask if they feel dizzy, or if they have a headache or if their vision is blurry. 
   - If a paitent is on the ground for a unknown or known reason, always put on a C-Collar to protect the victims spinal integrity. 
   - Check the persons blood pressure and their heart rate. For reference, a normal blood pressure is 120/80 and a normal heart rate is 60-100 bpm. 
   - Ask if the person has any allergies to medication. Make sure to ask if they are alert, as some medication allergies can be life threatning. 


  ### 10. Questions and Evaluations

    Once all sections are done, evaluate whether the Cadet(s) are ready to be Firefighters. If you feel they need more training in medical or firefighting, you can have them redo that portion in a different training, and let them pass on the other section, with a warning that they cannot do that failed section until they pass it. If they have any questions, make sure to answer them in as much detail as possible, to ensure they are not confused.
