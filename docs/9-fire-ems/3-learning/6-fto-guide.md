## Sections 1-3 / Accepting and Initial Setup

Before training starts, we need to ensure the Cadet(s) are ready and have all the necessary tools and information to participate fully. This section will cover initial setup of the cad and prepation for the training session, as well as making sure the Cadet(s) has the necessary permissions before they log online and start training. 


## Application & Review

A recruit will submit an application [here](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/leo/apply#application-process), Upon submission of the application a ticket will be opened in the Discord server with the application. We will review the applicant application in the private thread attached.

Once reviewed and accepted, We will move forward with the FTO process.

## Discord Roles

Upon acceptance before training we will grant the department specific role along with the department recruit role to the member.
This will grant the recruit all the permissions in the CAD and in-game.

Then post in the [#roster-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1270093499110395944) the updated positions!

The recruit will likely need to fully logout of the [CAD](https://cad.kcdojrp.com) and re-login via Discord to gain access to the new permissions.

If the recruit doesn't already have a citizen in the CAD they will need to [create one.](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/cad/citizens)

Next, Head over to the "Deputy" tab and then "[My Deputies](https://cad.kcdojrp.com/officer/my-officers)". Select "Create Deputy" select the citizen, and give the call sign based off the [roster](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/fire-ems/roster).

From here, Have the recruit go Busy for the first time on the Officer Dashboard!

<br/>
### 3. Officer & CAD Setup

The recruit will now be instructed to follow the [Officer Setup](/docs/law-enforcement/learning/setting-up) guide to set up their officer on the CAD System with the information provided by the supervisor.

<br/>

<br/>

**Information that will be provided to the recruit:**
- Their new call-sign
- The department they will be joining
- Their rank

<br/>

<details>
  <summary>FTO - Approving the recruit in the CAD System</summary>

  A supervisor will need to accept the officer's request to be added to the CAD System. You can do this by finding the user under `Admin > Manage Units > Pending Units` and clicking the `Approve` button.

  **Beware!** Make sure that the user has put in the correct call-sign! If they haven't, notify the user of the mistake and deny the officer request. They should re-submit their request on the CAD following the instructions in the [Deputy Setup](/docs/fire-ems/learning/setting-up) guide.

  Make sure to accept this request right before the training session starts, as we don't want the recruit to have access to the deputy side of the CAD System before their training session.
