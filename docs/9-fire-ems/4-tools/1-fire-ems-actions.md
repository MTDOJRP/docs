### Speed Zones Menu

A very useful feature that allows you to set a speed zone for nearby traffic and control the speed of vehicles in that zone. Useful for stopping pesky GTA:V AI vehicles from running you over in the middle of a scene!

You can find this menu in the **[F5 Menu](/docs/kc-menu/kcmenu)**.<br/>
And this is what the menu that you're looking for looks like:

  - **Speed Limit**: allows you to set a speed limit of how fast you want AI to move in your speed zone. This is useful if AI get spooked or a gun gets pulled out. Its helpful to keep the limit at zero, so they cant accidentally run you over. Note: This will not affect Players in any way. They can drive around the AI.<br/>
    *You can set any speed between `0` and `75` MPH for the speed limit.*

  - **Radius**: allows you to set as big as a radius you want to stop AI from moving, but it is important to keep it as small as possible so that it doesn't interrupt traffic as much.<br/>
    *You can set any number between `5` and `40` for the radius.*

  - **Create Speed Zone**: once you click this, the speed zone will be created around your current position!

:::warning Manage Speed Zones
At the top of that menu, you will see an option to `Manage Speed Zones`. This will allow you to delete any speed zones that have been created. Please avoid deleting other people's speed zones, as it can mess with their scenes.
