:::tip I've Been Accepted, What's next?
Congratulations on getting accepted into the Fire / EMS program! üéâ<br/>
It is now time to start preparing you for your training and testing.

Your new supervisors have likely given you a training date, so it's important to make sure you have all the information you need before your training date.
But before you do that, you need to [set up your deputy](/docs/fire-ems/learning/setting-up) on the CAD System.

<br/>

#### Learning Materials & Resources
- [First Shift](/docs/fire-ems/learning/first-shift) - Goes over the expectations for how to behave & what to expect from the department.
- **[Your Final Exam](/docs/fire-ems/learning/fto-guide) - Get an early peak at what you'll be doing during your training! We recommend you prepare for this exam before your training date.**

:::danger I've Been Denied, What's next?
Sorry to hear that you've been denied! Take this opportunity to learn from the feedback you received from your supervisors and try again in the future.

<br/>

#### Notes and Future Considerations
If you are still interested in applying, you can always apply again in the future.
- Keep in mind that we require applicants to wait at least **2 weeks** before applying again! This is to give you time to make any necessary changes to your application.
- Make sure that you study all of the learning materials and tools before trying again! A lot of the time, a denial is due to a lack of preparation.
