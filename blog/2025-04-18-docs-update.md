### Kelly County | Documentation v2 üéâ

Welcome to the new Kelly County Documentation (v2.0)! We are super excited to share all the **awesome features** and **improvements** that we have been working on throughout the last year and a bit.

It's not quite ready yet, but all of the old information and content has been fully moved over and migrated to the new documentation and layout. We are excited to share it with you all!

## üìö What's New?

<br/>

### (New!) Layout & Contents Page

We've updated the contents page to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate. It now includes a much more organized and clear structure, making it easier for you to find what you're looking for.

Alongside this, we've also updated the layout of both the **Navigation Bar** and the **Sidebar** to be more visually appealing and easier to use. Here's a snippet of what we've done!

<br/>

:::info A Fully Reworked Layout
This should hopefully make it super simple to find exactly what you're looking for. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kcdojrp)!

### (New!) Blog!

This here blog that you're reading right now is also a completely new thing! We want to be able to share everything we're working on with you all, and with how limited Discord is, we've decided to use a blog to do just that.

<br/>

:::info A New Way to Share
You can find the blog in the sidebar on the left, labelled as "What's New", in the table of contents and on the navigation bar!

### (New!) Public Commits on Discord!

We've added a new channel on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kcdojrp) called **[#project-commits](1362605191353991380)**. Every time we make a commit to a project (currently only the Kelly County Documentation & the Core Script for the FiveM Server), we'll automagically post a message describing the commit and the reasoning behind it.

This is a great way to keep track of what we're working on and what's coming up next by looking at the in-development branches!

### (Updated!) Law Enforcement, Fire & EMS Sections

We cleaned up everything within the **Law Enforcement** and **Fire & EMS** sections! Here's a small snippet of what we've done:

- **Added a new section labelled "Learning Materials"** - this is where you can find all of the resources and guides that we've created for you to learn about the various roles and responsibilities of each department.


- **Added a new section labelled "Tools"** - This is where you can find all of the tools and resources that we've created for you to use in the various roles and responsibilities of each department.

- **Fully re-worded all documentation** - We've gone through and re-worded all of the documentation to make it more clear and concise. We've also added more detailed explanations and examples wherever possible.

Why am I listing, let's just show you a small snippet!

:::tip Kelly County | v2.0.0 (Coming Soon!)
Don't think we forgot about v2.0 of Kelly County! We've been super busy with real-life things, but we're slowly getting back to work! Stay tuned for more updates!
:::

<br/>

We thought we'd share the documentation for the time being just to have something launch & keep things fresh. We'll be back soon with more updates!

After all, we're just a bunch of nerds working on a project together.
